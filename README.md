# AP Stats Audio Study

Can people discern mp3 quality?

# How to use this tool
This tool should be used to generate mp3 audio given a lossless format such as
 aif or wav. Execute the python file with the source path as the first
argument on the command line

Example usage:

```bash
python3 convert.py sources/sources/02\ Black\ Mambo.aiff
```

# Dependencies
Requires `ffmpeg`. I downloaded from [here](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
and added to my path.
